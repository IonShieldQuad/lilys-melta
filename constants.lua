-- beam look ------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Four stacked lines. Colours come from whichever fuel is burning (see C.fuels) and
-- the alphas ramp with charge: the sheath is the wide heat column, the core is the
-- thin cutting line that goes white-hot.

-- fuel -----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A fluid turret burns fluid per shot all by itself; the script adds a surcharge
-- while the beam is hot, so holding full intensity costs about twice the fuel.
-- 7.5 shots/s: 2.5 per shot = ~19/s cold, +3.8 per pulse at full charge = ~47/s hot
C.fluid_consumption         = 2.5    -- engine-side, fluid units per shot
C.extra_fluid_per_pulse_hot = 3.8    -- script-side, fluid units per pulse at full charge
C.fluid_buffer              = 200    -- ~4-10 s of beam in the buffer, so a short gap in the pipe is survivable

-- Anything in this list can be piped into the turret. Entries whose fluid does not
-- exist are skipped by BOTH stages, so listing another mod's fuel is safe with or
-- without that mod installed. `damage_modifier` multiplies the beam damage, like the
-- flamethrower's fluid bonuses.
-- `core` is the cutting line's colour, `sheath` the heat column around it, so the
-- fuel you burn is readable at a glance. Highest modifier present wins.
